📜 Shrine Browser Lite v14.4.0
- Optimized Context Menu
- Optimized Download in Hybrid Mode
- UI/UX Enhancement: Integrated Navigation Bar

URL Bar Modernization: Integrating the Search/Go and Bookmark buttons directly into the URL Bar using custom subclassing techniques.

Dynamic Layout Positioning: Implementing the resizeEvent on the URL Bar to ensure the buttons remain positioned precisely on the right side when the window is resized.

Smart Text Margins: Automatically adjusting input text margins to prevent URL content from overlapping action buttons within the bar.

Visual Refinement: Added transparent hover effects to the internal URL Bar buttons for a cleaner, more minimalist look.
