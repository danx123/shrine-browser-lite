üìú Shrine Browser Lite v5.5.5 Changelog
This is a significant update focused on improving the user experience (UX), adding advanced custom features, and improving stability based on feedback.

‚ú® New Features
Interactive Profile Menu:
The profile icon in the top left corner now functions as a menu button.
Displays a list of all currently open tabs, allowing quick, one-click navigation.
Displays a list of the five most recently closed tabs, making it easy to reopen accidentally closed pages.
Tab Preview Tooltip:
Hovering your mouse over a tab will display a custom tooltip.
The tooltip displays a thumbnail of the webpage content in that tab.
Includes information about estimated memory usage by the renderer process, providing insight into which tabs are consuming the most resources. (Requires the psutil library).
Force Dark Mode for Web Content:
Adds a new option in the Appearance > Theme menu to force a dark appearance on website content.
This feature intelligently injects CSS to change webpage colors to a dark theme, even on sites that don't have a built-in dark mode.
It can be enabled/disabled as desired and will take effect on new tabs or after reloading existing tabs.
Per-Site Zoom Persistence:
The browser now automatically remembers the zoom level you set for each domain.
When you revisit the site, the saved zoom level will be reapplied automatically, eliminating the need to reset the zoom every time.
üé® Enhancements & Changes
Chrome-Style Custom Link Tooltip:
Replaces the default link tooltip with a custom status bar that appears in the bottom-left corner of the browser window.
Provides a cleaner, more modern look and is consistent with major browsers like Google Chrome.
The status bar will automatically disappear after a few seconds or when the cursor is no longer hovering over the link.
üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes
Tab Preview Stability Fix:
Fixed a TypeError that occurred when attempting to create a tab preview thumbnail.
This issue was caused by a mismatch between the standard Python BytesIO object and the QIODevice expected by Qt/PySide6.
Solution: Implemented the use of Qt's QBuffer and QByteArray to process images in memory, ensuring full compatibility and stability.
Fixed Dark Mode Content Effectiveness:
Fixed an issue where the "Force Dark Mode" feature was not working on some websites.
This issue was caused by inappropriate timing and execution environment of the injected script.
Solution: Changed the injection point to DocumentReady and the world ID to MainWorld to ensure CSS scripts have the proper priority and access to effectively modify the web page's appearance.
